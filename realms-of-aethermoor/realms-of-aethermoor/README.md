# Realms of Aethermoor - Foundry VTT World

A complete D&D 5th Edition campaign world for Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## Overview

The Realms of Aethermoor is a rich fantasy setting built around the consequences of magical hubris. Five hundred years ago, the Arcane Empire's attempt to harness the raw power of the Aether led to a catastrophic magical explosion that shattered their civilization. Now, new kingdoms rise from the ruins, and adventurers seek fortune and glory among the dangerous remnants of the old world.

- **Major Factions**: Five distinct organizations with competing interests
- **Pre-Built NPCs**: Three fully-developed NPCs with personalities, bonds, ideals, and flaws
- **Magic Items**: Unique magical items tied to the world's lore
- **Adventure Hooks**: Five ready-to-use adventure seeds to start your campaign
