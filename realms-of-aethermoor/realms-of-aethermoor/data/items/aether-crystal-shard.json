Fragments of these crystals are found throughout the Realms of Aethermoor, remnants of the ancient magical catastrophe that shaped the land.</p><p><strong>Properties:</strong> The crystal can be used as a material component for spells that require a focus worth at least 50gp. Additionally, when held during a short rest, the bearer regains an additional 1d4 hit points.</p><p><strong>Value:</strong> 75gp</p>"
